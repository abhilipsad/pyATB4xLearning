#Identifiers are the names used to identify a variable, function, class, module, or other objects.
#They start with a letter (A-Z or a-z) or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0-9).
#Python is case-sensitive, so myVariable and myvariable are two different identifiers.
